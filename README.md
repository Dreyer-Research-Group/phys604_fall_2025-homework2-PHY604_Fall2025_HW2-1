# General instructions
Programs can be written in any language (but python is recommended). In addition to the program, you should have a writeup that contains the plots requested in the homework questions, answers to any analytical or explanation questions, and  a short description of your code and how to run it. This can be done in, e.g., latex, markdown, etc. Combining the code and writeup in jupyter notebooks is highly recommended. Code and writeup should be submitted using git via github in the repo
 that was created from github classroom link
 
# Instructions for turning in via github classroom:

In order to turn in the homeworks, you will need to install git on your computer and make a github account. You can see instructions for how to do this [here](https://docs.github.com/en). Let me know if you have issues doing this.

Once you have a github account, navigate to the following link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/pfPk9fHo](https://classroom.github.com/a/pfPk9fHo). This will allow you to link your github account to your name on the class roster (let me know if your name does not appear). Then a repo will be created for your assignment. You can clone it to you machine with a command that looks something like:

`git clone https://github.com/Dreyer-Research-Group/homework1-yourusername`

Some students have reported issues when cloning via https as in the line above. If this happens to you, you should try to set up SSH via the steps described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), and then your line to clone will look more like:

`git clone git@github.com:Dreyer-Research-Group/homework1-yourusername.git`

As you work on yout homework, you can `add` and `commit` changes. When you would like to turn in the assignment, make sure you have included all of the latest versions of your files in the latest commit and `push` to the github repo (i.e., with the command `git push`). You should be able to push changes until the deadline, which is **Oct. 1, 2025 at 23:59**, and feel free to `push` at intermediate points, either to back up your work, or if you need help with something (I am able to access your github repo).
